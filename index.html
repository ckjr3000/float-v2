<p>
    We meet on the <b>5th of every month, 17.30 - 19.30</b>, at various venues in <b>Huddersfield.</b>
</p>
<p>
    Meetups usually include some kind of activity, e.g a presentation, skill share, small performance or themed discussion.
</p>
<p>
    We are always on the lookout for new members! Whether you're interested in creative coding, game development, digital art, or anything else under the 
    banner of 'creative technology', please feel free to come along.
