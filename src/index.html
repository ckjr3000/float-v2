    <h2>Monthly Creative Technology Meet Ups in Huddersfield</h2>
    <p>
        FLOAT is an open collective for anyone who identifies as queer or as belonging to a marginalised gender interested in creative technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        We meet on the <b>5th of every month, 17.30 - 19.30</b>, at various venues in <b>Huddersfield.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Meet ups usually include some kind of activity, e.g a presentation, skill share, small performance or themed discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are always on the lookout for new members! Whether you're interested in creative coding, game development, digital art, or anything else under the
