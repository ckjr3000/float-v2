Layla Klimova is an electronic musician from Latvia via Croydon, currently exploring the timbres of language and urban landscapes. She will be performing new piece “data morganas”, where body and environment will become the stage for crystalline sounds, smudged spoken word and imagined futures.

### Mia Windsor

Mia Windsor is an experimental musician currently interested creating complex systems to perform with and respond to by connecting bodies (at the moment this includes metal, glass, strings and voices/mouths) to themselves and each other via routing, digital processing and resonance. She also really likes pipe organs.
