17.30 â€“ 19.30

For the first FLOAT meetup of the year, we're asking everyone to bring something technical they could use some extra heads on.

This could be a guitar pedal you can't work out how to fix, I piece of code that's not doing what you want, or an artwork you can't quite get to 'finished'. Let's pool our collective brain power to help each other out.

## Where?
