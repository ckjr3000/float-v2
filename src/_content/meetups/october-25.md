For October's meet-up we will be joined by PHD researcher in Music, Millie Fisher.

Broadly Millie’s research looks at how music and sound represents concepts of gender, status, and identity, with a particular focus on ideas of ‘femininity’ in period dramas. In particular this work makes use of gender theory as a framework to explore the adaptation of femininity from book to screen and how this is done through music. This talk will broadly cover the literature that Millie is using as part of her PhD, exploring some of the more problematic aspects of gender in film music, such as the ‘male gaze’, and also discuss how this initially relates to period dramas.
