17.30 â€“ 19.30 

For the last FLOAT meetup of the year, we're asking everyone to bring something technical they could use some extra heads on.

This could be a guitar pedal you can't work out how to fix, I piece of code that's not doing what you want, or an artwork you can't quite get to 'finished'. Let's pool our collective brain power to help each other out.

We'll use the last 30 minutes of the meeting to go over what we did this year and plan what we want to do next year! (This may spill into the pub post 19.30).
