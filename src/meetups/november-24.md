November's meetup will include a demonstration of Mia Windsor's current live electronics setup which she uses to connect physical bodies through digital processing in complex dynamical systems. The current setup involves resonating a cymbal and a glass with transducers and connecting them to themselves and each other via frequency domain audio processing and feedback.
