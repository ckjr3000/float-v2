17.30 – 19.30 

Join Web Developer & Artist, <a href="https://charlotteroe.space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlotte Roe ↗</a> for a 
basic introduction to ✨✨ HTML ✨✨.

HTML is the fundamental language of web development, and all you need to start publishing your own web pages.

During the session, we'll work, step by step, through creating a web page to advertise an event, how to style it, and how to publish it online completely free.

This is a very beginner friendly workshop, with no prior experience required.

**NOTE**: This session will serve, in part, as research and development for a longer series of 'DIY Web Development' workshops, so people experienced with coding are very much welcome to come along and provide input!
