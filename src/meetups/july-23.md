The first monthly ‘FLOAT’ meetup people who identify as queer and/or as belonging to a marginalised gender, interested in creative technology. This could be creative coding, web design, digital art, game development, electronic/digital music or something else we haven’t thought of!

Free entry, hot and cold drinks provided, come meet other artists/creatives/technologists in a friendly, casual environment.

This month’s meetup will include a presentation from sound artist, Huddersfield-based [Ryoko Akama](https://ryokoakama.com/) introducing her ongoing interest on heat and temperature. Ryoko has been examining on various methods to amplify the sound of water dripping onto hotplates to create rhythmic patterns. She will discuss her idea, demonstrate its process, and discuss achievement and issues
