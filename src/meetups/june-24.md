June's meetup will be an open meeting for anyone to discuss their current projects, thoughts, and ideas.


## Where?

[Hive Community Cafe](https://www.hivecommunity.org.uk/), 46 John William St, Huddersfield HD1 1ER 

**Note:** As Hive are kindly opening out of hours and letting us use the space without charge, we'd encourage buying a drink or piece of cake to support their overheads.
