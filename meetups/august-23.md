17.30 – 19.30

Free entry, drinks and snacks provided, come meet other artists/creatives/technologists in a friendly, casual environment.

This month’s meetup will include a presentation and demonstration from composer and improviser [Mia Windsor](https://miawindsor.com/) about how she approaches resynthesising sounds in her live setups and how new approaches to harmony, microtonality and spectral processing have emerged from this.
