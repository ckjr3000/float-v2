    <p>17.30 – 19.30</p>
<p>On the 5th of August, Freya Shaw, Founder and Chief Programmer at Immersion Sound Studio, a company specialising in creating software for blind and visually impaired users, will host a session presenting Hodr Engine, a game engine designed for users of any sight condition or skill level to develop immersive experiences such as video games. These experiences can be played by blind, visually impaired, and sighted users alike through accessible features, such as Spatial Audio and audio beacons.</p>
<p>During the session, Freya will walk through the development of Hodr Engine’s commercial version, tracing its journey from the end of an early prototype created during her master’s research at the University of Huddersfield to its current iteration. She will also present a live demonstration of the engine ahead of its upcoming beta release.</p>
<p>Participants will also have the opportunity to explore a demo game created with the engine, and provide feedback on how Hodr Engine can be further improved before launch. There is no need to bring a computer, as everything can be accessed directly on the presenter's MacBook.</p>
