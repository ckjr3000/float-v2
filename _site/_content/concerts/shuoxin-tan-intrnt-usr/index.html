<p>Shuoxin Tan was born in Beijing, now she is living and working as a
freelance composer and sound artist in Cologne. How to apply
“purloined” theory and knowledge into artistic practice is her curiosity.
She approaches and works between composition and improvisation,
which often happens in specific space, intertwined with the exploration
of physical movement and auditory perception</p>
