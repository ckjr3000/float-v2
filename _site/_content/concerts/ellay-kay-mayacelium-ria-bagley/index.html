<p>Ella Kay (she/they) is an electroacoustic composer, sound artist and designer, and saxophonist from Oldham, UK. Her work focuses on conceptual storytelling through the use of field recordings, voice and abstracted sound, often treading the spatial balance between the natural and urban via a mixture of fixed sound artworks, interactive media and live performances.</p>
<p>In 2022, The Radiophonic Institute and PRS Foundation recognised her work with an Oram Award for Innovation in Sound, Music and New Technology. Her music and research have been presented in festivals and conferences in the UK and internationally, and she has worked professionally in sound design for theatre, radio, podcasts and music.</p>

<p>&quot;I am a interdisciplinary artist, I create immersive and democratic experiences for audiences/participants, leaning into my past work in radio, audiowalks and live art. My practice interrogates themes such as world water scarcity, food sovereignty, and climate justice. I am currently exploring biodata sonification; turning brainwaves into melodies and plant waves into soundwaves – seeking to find a shared language between the human and the more-than-human.&quot;</p>
